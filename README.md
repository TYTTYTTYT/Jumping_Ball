# Jumping_Ball
## How to use it?
Run the multiproc.py directly.

## Structure
The aim of this program is to practice Matplotlib and multiprocessing for parallel computation of python. 

The program incorporates a back-end process which calculate the balls' position in real-time and synthesis the real-time animation using matplotlib in another process. The physical collision effect is calculated by solving the functions of energy and momentum conservation.
